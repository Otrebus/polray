Fix rendering exposure to use luminance as input for exp
Add light source resampling to BDPT
Copy to clipboard feature
Make TraceShadowRay account for light portals
Unhardcode light area sampling in light portal
Constexpr template intpow
Clean up Ashikhmin & other materials
Read light sources from .mtl files
Instead of intersect -> generateintersectioninfo just add a boolean to generate intersectioninfo when intersecting, also consider removing the minprimitive thing and just have info
Modules?
Fix the friend/attourney etc relationships and private fields in general
(mostly for "fun") Make light portals work inside scenes
Use more modern threads
Add physical camera to bdpt
Make various functions return a tuple instead of taking output parameters
- Make mr. lightportal use next event estimation
- Try including rr with mis o
- Investigate BDPT fireflies
- Add support for proper environment light sources
- Check that materials can be assigned to different faces (e.g. the microwave in interior.obj)
- Add lightportal/serialize (save)
- Debug SphereLight + LightPortal (the spherelight didn't self-intersect)
- Replace the .0000001s with eps
- Unify all the different intersect() methods with different tmin/tmaxes
- Unify the above in KDTree
- Remove sampling components
- Unify sample/sampleE
