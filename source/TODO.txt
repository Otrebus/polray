Make various functions return a tuple instead of taking output parameters
Clean up Ashikhmin & other materials
Copy to clipboard feature
Read light sources from .mtl files
Fix rendering exposure to use luminance as input for exp
Instead of intersect -> generateintersectioninfo just add a boolean to generate intersectioninfo when intersecting, also consider removing the minprimitive thing and just have info
Use more modern threads
Make TraceShadowRay account for light portals
Think of a better way of dealing with epsilons - account for numerical errors etc
Add light source resampling to BDPT
Unhardcode light area sampling in light portal
Implement multiple importance sampling for light portals
Fix the friend/attourney etc relationships and private fields in general
(mostly for "fun") Make light portals work inside scenes
Add physical camera to bdpt
Add check that all primitives have materials, in scene
- Change the DirectHitMIS etc stuff
- Make mr. lightportal use next event estimation
- Try including rr with mis o
- Investigate BDPT fireflies
- Add support for proper environment light sources
- Check that materials can be assigned to different faces (e.g. the microwave in interior.obj)
- Add lightportal/serialize (save)
- Debug SphereLight + LightPortal (the spherelight didn't self-intersect)
- Replace the .0000001s with eps
- Unify all the different intersect() methods with different tmin/tmaxes
- Unify the above in KDTree
- Remove sampling components
- Unify sample/sampleE
